## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the personal projects created along my journey into full-stack development. I chose to use simple HTML, CSS and Javascript because using React or other frameworks seemed like overkill for what is a rather simple project. 
Designed with a focus on modern web technologies and best practices, this portfolio stands as a testament to my dedication, learning, and the hands-on skills I've acquired in software development.
